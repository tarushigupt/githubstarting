# githubstarting
github-website that allows developers to store and manage their code using git
we use "cd" - when we go inside the folder
we use "ls"  (To see all files)
we use "ls-a" (to see hidden files)
git clone <- some link ->( to cloning a repository on our local machine)
we use git add<-file name-> (to adds new or changed files in your working directory to the git staging area)
we use (git commit -m "some message") to commit (It is record of changes)
we use git push origin main (to upload local repo content to remote repo)
we use git inlit (to create a new git repo)
we use git branch (to check branch)
we use git branch -M main (to rename)
we use git checkout <-branch name->(to navigate)
git checkout-b<-new branch name->(to create new branch)
git checkout-d<-new branch name->(to delete branch)
1st way to merge the code is gitdiff<-branch name->(to compare commits,branches,files & more)then git merge<-branch name->(to merge 2 branches)
2nd way create a pull request(it's let you tell others about chenges you have pushed to a branch in a repository on github)
git pull origin main (used to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update the local repo to match the content)
